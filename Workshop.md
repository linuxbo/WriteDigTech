This project is in keeping with presentation/workshop situations common to professional and academic conferences. Each graduate student must research and lead an approximately 25-minute teaching session on a particular writing practice or technology pertinent to the class for that week. In short, based on what we are covering for that week, consider what technology or best practice your peers will need and want to learn.

You must provide me with at least 2 weeks notice, so we can decide what might work best for everyone. Also, after choosing your week and talking to me, you can poll your peers about what tech / practice is most desirable.

The session must include a:

Short history of the tech / practice (2-3 minutes),

Short, high-level description about the purpose and functional properties of the tech / practice (5 minutes),

Tutorial-workshop component to help your colleagues learn how and when to use this tech / practice (15-18 minutes), and

"Best practices" and resources handout for everyone.


Grading rubric:

Adheres to the required components and time constraints noted above.

Demonstrates audience awareness, e.g., provides access to manageable slides and notes, responds to prior and in situ audience needs/questions,

Workshop / tutorial addresses 1 - 2 particular tasks. If workshop is on particular technology, then it should focus on 2-3 features that support tasks that ally with the goals of your peers.

Handout includes sources and resources, as well as condensed "rules of thumb"

He wants to meet with you next week. You're scheduling stuff.

## History

## Purpose

The purpose is kinda tied into the history. As web needs evolved, espeically with mobile and tablets being commonly used, the designs needed to be able to handle it. 

## Tutorial

How to tutorial responsive design when people haven't even writen HTML yet. Questions, questions indeed.

I can provide an HTML layout and we can play with the CSS files. That's still a bit scary. Offline website, obviously. 

Also it would be hard to demonstrate on a mobile phone. I don't have access to an IOS Simulator, and the Android simulator will help no one. I can screen shot my own phone, but during a demo that's a bit risky. We'll just demonstrate with browser resizing.

The when is obviously when you want your users to see the site look good regardless of screen size. The how is quite the chunk of information.

## Best Practices

That I should research more.
