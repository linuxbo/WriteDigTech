browsers have always been forgiving of HTML errors, 

but nobody had ever bothered to write down exactly 

how they did it." 


This article explores the development of how browsers interpret HTML to show how web standards can change. It starts with a report of the development of the image tag. Several developers tossed around various ideas for what they were implementing in their browsers, and finally a concencious was reached by the developer who released their product first. There were concerns about how a variety of media that might need to be on the web would appear in HTML, but eventually standards were developed around those as well. After a while, reverse compatiabilty was needed with older HTML. There was an attempted split of web standards between XHTML and HTML. However, XHTML ultimately failed, as its ultimate solution was to break things that didn't fit its standards. Groups of people were also created to try and adjust HTML to work across browsers that were not treating the markup the same. These groups evolved the web standards by desecting how each browser interpreted the code, and brought browser behaviors closer to a standard. Standards are still being developed today, but it seems that HTML will continue to be a retroactively inclusive language, which still accomodating for the future.
