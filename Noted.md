# Instructions

As you can read on the schedule, you will have 2 sections within your post: 1) Summaries of each article, and 2) Connections that you see between the articles. Your summaries in the Summaries section should include the following: 

The author's exigence, or what issue, problem, or concern they are responding to;

The author's main argument and some major claims that support it;

Some points of particular interest to you and what you think about such arguments, claims, and evidence.

Cite page numbers where you find discussions, ideas, etc., even if you do not quote directly. This is just god practice to help you and your readers find what you are talking about in the texts. It will also help during our in-class discussions.

The Connections section should discuss 1-2 ways you see how these readings inter-relate. Maybe make a list of what and where you see such cross-connections. Then, jot some ideas down about such connections, which will, I think, help you write it out in your post on Prose.io.

## Handwriting


## Table History

"I want to suggest we read 'international compliant' as the expression of a problem: the widespread (even global) collapse of design diversity caused by preference for complicance over style." (223)

Is it compliance or usability? It's both, I'm sure, but there's a difference between 'This design isn't unique' and 'No one knows how to use our website'.

## Grids

Patrick Brosset has written up an overview of the upcoming CSS Grid Layout technology. This is new, browser-native way to manage website layouts. The grid layout helps align various-sized content neatly, with minimal to no HTML markup to designate the areas of the webpage. The layout is instead managed in pure CSS, which allows easy layout adjustment for different device types (mobile vs. desktop) and allows the layout code to not be as intertwined with other code. Brosset explains this new process, in hopes to spread knowledge about this upcoming technology.

As someone with web development experience, I very much see the use of this technology. It can't be used quite yet, because not all of the most commonly used browers support it, but it is solving a very common problem:

"We could even completely reshuffle the order of items in the grid without having to change the order in the markup."

I think this is the key usefulness of this feature. CSS can make things smaller or shifted to the left or right, but it isn't powerful enough to move content from (for example) the top of a page to somewhere in the middle. A big limitation you hit when programming a mobile website layout, or similarly small layout, is that the content itself needs different HTML to look good. Websites can be told to load a different CSS when being viewed on a phone than when viewed on a computer, but not new HTML. Many websites even have their own mobile website rather than trying to adjust the layout of their desktop website to look decent on a mobile phone. The grid layout would be able to help that issue.

Tools like the Bootstrap Library, mentioned at the bottom of the article, are basically faking what the grid layout would do. It would also mean developers don't need use a third-party tool to get this functionality, but that it will work in most modern browsers automatically. The less third-party libraries a website needs to load and process in the background, the faster a website will work, which is also a major benefit.
