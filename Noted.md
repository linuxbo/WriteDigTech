# Instructions

As you can read on the schedule, you will have 2 sections within your post: 1) Summaries of each article, and 2) Connections that you see between the articles. Your summaries in the Summaries section should include the following: 

The author's exigence, or what issue, problem, or concern they are responding to;

The author's main argument and some major claims that support it;

Some points of particular interest to you and what you think about such arguments, claims, and evidence.

Cite page numbers where you find discussions, ideas, etc., even if you do not quote directly. This is just god practice to help you and your readers find what you are talking about in the texts. It will also help during our in-class discussions.

The Connections section should discuss 1-2 ways you see how these readings inter-relate. Maybe make a list of what and where you see such cross-connections. Then, jot some ideas down about such connections, which will, I think, help you write it out in your post on Prose.io.

"I want to suggest we read 'international compliant' as the expression of a problem: the widespread (even global) collapse of design diversity caused by preference for complicance over style." (223)

Is it compliance or usability? It's both, I'm sure, but there's a difference between 'This design isn't unique' and 'No one knows how to use our website'.
