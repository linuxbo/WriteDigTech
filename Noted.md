# Instructions

As you can read on the schedule, you will have 2 sections within your post: 1) Summaries of each article, and 2) Connections that you see between the articles. Your summaries in the Summaries section should include the following: 

The author's exigence, or what issue, problem, or concern they are responding to;

The author's main argument and some major claims that support it;

Some points of particular interest to you and what you think about such arguments, claims, and evidence.

Cite page numbers where you find discussions, ideas, etc., even if you do not quote directly. This is just god practice to help you and your readers find what you are talking about in the texts. It will also help during our in-class discussions.

The Connections section should discuss 1-2 ways you see how these readings inter-relate. Maybe make a list of what and where you see such cross-connections. Then, jot some ideas down about such connections, which will, I think, help you write it out in your post on Prose.io.


# Week 2

## Handwriting

Brandon Keim describes how writing things by hand affects the brain. It specifically targets whether writing things by hand benefits memory and a connection with the text. The article discussed whether children writing by-hand less today is going to affect their cognitive abilities. Keim references several small uncontrolled studies where participants who used handwriting rather than typing ended up benefitting in one way or the other. For example, in a study where participants were taught another alphabet, the ones who handwrote the alphabet recalled the new characters better in the future (4). Although lacking hard evidence, Keim concludes that writing by hand feels good, appears to be helpful and implys this is an area that should be studied more. 

I found this article facinating. I have a learning disability (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia) that affects my handwriting significantly, to the point it's illegible. That being said, I still take my notes in class by hand, because I find that easier than typing. Handwriting may not be an effective way for me to communicate with other people, but I prefer using it when writing to myself. I guess I'd agree with the comments that it helps me "sense of my text" (6) and it helps me remember things better. Regarding note-taking, I feel it is significantly easier to listen and write than listen and type.

## Table History

Bradley Dilger discussed the history of the table HTML tag, and its use and abuse over time. In the past, the table tag was used and even recommended as a way to arrange the layouts of webpages. Web design ended up evolving around decisions made around needed to use table layouts, like text commonly being left-aligned. As coding standards evolved, the table tag was less recommended for layouts, and more for content organization. Layouts should now be made with CSS, but CSS layouts still end up looking very grid-like. Dilger asserts that the grid-like layout of the web has limited designs for websites in a negative way. It is stated that 'breaking' the grid-like layout would lead to a design revolution, but that what necessarily looks good on  page-layout tool is not nescessarily implementable with tables or CSS (223). Dilger suggests we need a 'Grid 2.0' to help re-tool the grid mentality.

I am very tempted to call the last few pages of the article pretentious, with it's relating rebellious web design to a politcal revolution, but I do think there is a point burried in there. Most websites looks fairly similar, and it would be nice to shake it up. While I can agree with Dilgers point, I have a stipulation.

"I want to suggest we read 'international compliant' as the expression of a problem: the widespread (even global) collapse of design diversity caused by preference for complicance over style." (223)

Is it compliance or usability? It's both, I'm sure, but there's a difference between 'This design isn't unique' and 'No one knows how to use our website.' It is discussed why the web evolved to be grid-like, and even acknowledged that web technologies are currently only build to support that. What Dilger doesn't mention is that because grids are how the internet has worked for so long, users expect content to be delivered in a grid-like format. 

When a user visits a website, they should be table to find and do what they need to quite quickly with minimal instruction. No one wants to use the website it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to use. They'll go somewhere else. If a user is looking for what books they can purchase at a bookstores website, they will expect to see a list of books. How many ways can you present a large list in an immediately understood way? How many of those ways look like a grid? My answer is 'all of them,' but I'm not a designer. Retraining how people have learned to use the internet will be another issue moving off a grid-like layout will cause.

## Grids

Patrick Brosset has written up an overview of the upcoming CSS Grid Layout technology. This is new, browser-native way to manage website layouts. The grid layout helps align various-sized content neatly, with minimal to no HTML markup to designate the areas of the webpage. The layout is instead managed in pure CSS, which allows easy layout adjustment for different device types (mobile vs. desktop) and allows the layout code to not be as intertwined with other code. Brosset explains this new process, in hopes to spread knowledge about this upcoming technology.

As someone with web development experience, I very much see the use of this technology. It can't be used quite yet, because not all of the most commonly used browers support it, but it is solving a very common problem:

"We could even completely reshuffle the order of items in the grid without having to change the order in the markup."

I think this is the key usefulness of this feature. CSS can make things smaller or shifted to the left or right, but it isn't powerful enough to move content from (for example) the top of a page to somewhere in the middle. A big limitation you hit when programming a mobile website layout, or similarly small layout, is that the content itself needs different HTML to look good. Websites can be told to load a different CSS when being viewed on a phone than when viewed on a computer, but not new HTML. Many websites even have their own mobile website rather than trying to adjust the layout of their desktop website to look decent on a mobile phone. The grid layout would be able to help that issue.

Tools like the Bootstrap Library, mentioned at the bottom of the article, are basically faking what the grid layout would do. It would also mean developers don't need use a third-party tool to get this functionality, but that it will work in most modern browsers automatically. The less third-party libraries a website needs to load and process in the background, the faster a website will work, which is also a major benefit.
