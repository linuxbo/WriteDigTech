Write a post on Prose.io, documenting insights gleaned from this assignment, and save it to your team folder in wk4. I expect you to apply the conceptual framework surrounding mediation and a practice account of writing to your understanding of writing HTML and CSS.


1) Pure.CSS is confusing. I felt like I was typing in random numbers and the text would either: randomly overlap itself, not change, or magically work. I still don't get it.

2) I did the Pure.CSS version first just for the layout, then I added CSS to make it not be just white, then I did the vanilla CSS version to get close to whatever Pure.CSS generated. I wasn't sure how the pure.css version would look or what it could do, so which is why I did that first. 

3) Floating headers has always been a pain, and continued it's tradition. I only tested in Chrome. I have no idea what a mess I made in other browsers.

4) I have no idea what "conceptual framework surrounding mediation" means.

"thinkers try to look at how a given medium reconciles the various forces of history, culture, economics or the material world, and how social actors use that medium to navigate these various meanings and values."

I started this assignment by playing with the pure.CSS framework. I figured I could see what that framework could do, and then I would recode the website as close as I could without a framework. I chose pure.css because I had used bootstrap before, but pure.css was new to me. 

I mostly just used the Grids feature (http://purecss.io/grids/) to position elements on the page. I didn't really set out with a goal, I just wanted to see what it would do.

What is did most of this time was this:
