Historicizing a Web Technology Website (Undergraduate: 30% of total grade; Graduate: 25% of total grade)

Deadlines: prototype (10/27), revised website (11/24)

A critical element to understanding any literacy technology is to understand how even the newest digital media is intertwined with older media and the cussedness of human (in)decision (See Fig. 2). In this writing project, I am asking you to historicize a soft Web technology and the complexity of human decision-making driving its development. To help define the shape of this assignment, let me explain what I mean by historicizing and soft.

Historicizing, according to Writing Studies researcher, Christina Haas (1996), is "the reciprocal process of placing computer literacy technologies into historical contexts and, in turn, using those historical contexts to more fully understand today's technologies" (p. 205). As Haas notes, this process is complicated, as is it a complicating process. By conducting this research process, you will need to address 1) the political and rhetorical movements motivating a soft web technologies development, and 2) how this particular technology is shaped by print media.

Soft technology, in the context of this assignment, is an HTML-minded element with a standards body making decisions about its development. Examples include HTML and CSS elements, as well as their respective attributes and properties. If you're interested in visual modalities and their links with written modes, you can historicize soft technologies such as image file formats (.gif, .jpeg, .png), video codecs (FFMPEG, H.264/MPEG-4, WebM), or HTML elements like <svg>, <picture>, <img>, or <video>. Or, you could historicize a particular newer design technology, such as flexbox, tracing its cultural history and the implications of its use currently. Most importantly, historicizing a soft technology must be bounded by your desire to understand its link to print media and learning how to incorporate it into your web-based writing process.

Overall, your task is to research, analyze, and write in modalities akin to the soft-tech being examined. You will have until week 8 of the semester (10/27) to create a protoype website about this particular technology, discussing its links with print media and the "many 'voices'" (Haas, 1996, p. 165) driving its development. I say "prototype," because you must revise this project within 1 month after its first due date.

Grading rubric

Demonstrates your ability to establish a lineage between old and new technologies and the properties of such a relationship
Grounds the historical project within a particular community and culture, using the practice framework as your analytic framework. Such a task typically locates some point of conflict or (mis)appropriation of a particular tool within the bounds of a community's writing practice (cf. Dilger, 2010; or the semantics and motives behind git's "fork" feature).
Constructs some preliminary core categories about the writing practices bound to the technology.
Historicizing website incorporates the particular writing modes linked to the soft technology.
File naming and folder hierarchy are clean and logical.
HTML markup validates. Use the W3C online validator tool: https://validator.w3.org/.
HTML & CSS are clean with proper syntax and spacing, as well as an appropriate amount of commenting.




##This Weeks Posts


HTML5: Discuss the implications for using HTML5 on older browsers, which Duckett and Pilgrim both address. Your 2 other sources should focus on some particular HTML5 possibly some aspect of your chosen source.
Historicizing Pitch: Pitch 2-3 web technologies that you are considering to historicize. Each of them must be connected to a particular writing and design practice. Address the following questions in subsections: What practices are linked to this technology: tools, community knowledge and values, & skills? What competing issues or trends are you interested in investigating in more detail? Why?

##And then I wrote things

I'm doing the history of web video. Whether that is too vauge/broad is an issue.

If that's too vauge I am doing the death of flash. Overlapping resources FTW.
