### Handwriting

Brandon Keim describes how writing things by hand affects the brain. His article specifically targets whether writing things by hand benefits memory and a connection with the text. The article discusses whether children using handwriting less today is going to affect their cognitive abilities. Keim references several small, uncontrolled studies where participants who used handwriting rather than typing ended up benefitting in one way or the other. For example, in a study where participants were taught another alphabet, the ones who handwrote the alphabet recalled the new characters better in the future (4). Although lacking hard evidence, Keim concludes that writing by hand feels good, and appears to be helpful. The article concludes by implying this is an area that should be studied more. 

I found this article fascinating. I still take my notes in class by hand, because I find that easier than typing. I guess I'd agree with the articles comments that it helps me "sense of my text" (6) and it helps me remember things better. Regarding note-taking, I feel it is significantly easier to listen and write than listen and type, but I’m not sure why. I have gotten into the habit of typing my grocery list on my phone, but that’s mostly because when I think of what I need, I don’t tend to have paper and a pen on me.

### Table History

Bradley Dilger discussed the history of the table HTML tag, and its use and abuse over time. In the past, the table tag was used and even recommended as a way to arrange the layouts of webpages. Web design ended up evolving around decisions made around needed to use table layouts, like text commonly being left-aligned. As coding standards evolved, the table tag was less recommended for layouts, and more for content organization. Layouts should now be made with CSS, but CSS layouts still end up looking very grid-like. Dilger asserts that the grid-like layout of the web has limited designs for websites in a negative way. It is stated that 'breaking' the grid-like layout would lead to a design revolution, but that what necessarily looks good on  page-layout tool is not necessarily implementable with tables or CSS (223). Dilger suggests we need a 'Grid 2.0' to help re-tool the grid mentality.

I can agree with the article that most websites looks fairly similar, but have an additional thought that I don’t feel he explored.

"I want to suggest we read 'international compliant' as the expression of a problem: the widespread (even global) collapse of design diversity caused by preference for compliance over style." (223)

Is it compliance or usability? There is a line between 'This design isn't unique' and 'No one knows how to use our website.' It is discussed why the web evolved to be grid-like, and even acknowledged that web technologies are best built to support that. What Dilger doesn't mention is that because grids are how the internet has worked for so long, users expect content to be delivered in a grid-like format. 

When a user visits a website, they should be table to find and do what they need to quickly with minimal instruction. Most people will not use a website that requires a tutorial to understand; they'll go somewhere else. If a user is looking for what books they can purchase at a bookstore’s website, they will expect to see a list of books. How many ways can you present a large list in an immediately understood way? 

How many of those ways look like a grid? 

Retraining how people have learned to use the internet will be another issue moving off a grid-like layout will cause.

### Grids
Patrick Brosset has written up an overview of the upcoming CSS Grid Layout technology. This is new, browser-native way to manage website layouts. The grid layout helps align various-sized content neatly, with minimal to no HTML markup to designate the areas of the webpage. The layout is instead managed in pure CSS, which allows easy layout adjustment for different device types (mobile vs. desktop) and allows the layout code to not be as intertwined with other code. Brosset explains this new process, in hopes to spread knowledge about this upcoming technology.

As someone with web development experience, I very much see the use of this technology. It can't be used quite yet, because not all of the most commonly used browsers support it, but it is solving a very common problem:

"We could even completely reshuffle the order of items in the grid without having to change the order in the markup."

I think this is the key usefulness of this feature. HTML tells the browser that content exists in an order and grouping, and CSS tells the browser how to display the HTML. CSS can make things smaller or shifted to the left or right, but it isn't powerful enough to move content from (for example) the top of a page to somewhere in the middle. Websites can be told to load a different CSS configuration when being viewed on a phone than when viewed on a computer, but not new HTML.  A big limitation you hit when programming a mobile website layout is that the page needs different HTML to look good. Many websites even have their own, separate mobile website rather than trying to adjust the layout of their desktop website to look decent on a mobile phone. The grid layout would be able to help that issue.

### Old and New Technology

"On the Relationship between Old and New Technologies" takes a look at three separate workplace studies to see how these workplaces use various communicative technologies. The work environments were varied. A team of city engineers used many forms of written technology (from CAD software to passed memos) smoothly and successfully even though the team was split between a consulting firm and government employees. A small-town city manager’s office is lacking an e-mail system, but this is preferred by some to the point there is resistance to setting up an e-mail system. While there were problems noted that could be solved with digital technology, such as the notifications of meetings not being timely (217), other forms of communication were still preferred. Lastly, an abortion clinic handles patient information on blue paper passed throughout the clinic, and is required by law to provide a brochure that need to be given to the patient before any procedures. The study of the clinic revealed there is subtle political motivations behind the placements of the brochures that affect the patients’ use of the document and that the blue paper patient information is held on is powerful enough to bring work to halt if it goes missing.

The author uses the case studies, as well as borrowing from the analysis of other researcher's views of technical evolution, to demonstrate that technology does not simply advance in a linear pattern over time to better and better solutions. Technology does not always have to be the most advanced to be effective, and new technology may be rejected by those who do not see the use of it. Furthermore, there are many technologies at use in a workplace that aid communication, including e-mails, schematics, charts and even phone calls. One is not inherently better than the other and not one is inherently the best for any work environment. The article concludes by calling for more studies to focus on the history of new and old technologies and how they are intertwined to fully understand how technology affects communication.

That was a bit hard to summarize; it was a very thick article. 

My favorite part of this article was the mentioning that the exact same technology can be viewed differently by different people. Specifically, on pages 15 and 16, the discussion on how a penny-farthing bicycle could be viewed as dangerous (non-working) or cool (working). That idea heavily relates to the case study examples. The city manager who wanted e-mail wasn't able to implement that system because members of the town saw the technology as non-working. The same thing happened at the abortion clinic with the brochure: the clinic did not see it as working technology, and subsequently didn't treat it as such. Its users in return did not treat it as working, and mostly ignored it. 
I think that is an important perspective when choosing a technology that I didn't fully consider before. The concept is not difficult, but it's easy to get wrapped up in one’s own opinion of a technology that considering how others feel about it or would use it is forgotten.

## Connections

There is a clear connection between the grid article and the table history article. I would say the grid article is a step towards the Grid 2.0 discussed in the table article. That being said, the author of the table article would probably be disheartened by that: a grid is, well, a grid. Everything is going to stay square shaped; there hasn't been advances to totally revolutionize how a grid can appear. I don't think the benefits of the grid system are benefits that the table article was looking for. 

There is also a connection between the handwriting article and the old and new technology article. The handwriting article is discussing if aspects of learning and connecting with text are lost when things are typed instead of handwritten. This would be a discussion of old and new technology. The handwriting article evidence demonstrates that sometimes handwriting is preferable, and that preference can simply be a matter of opinion. This related to the Old and New article’s ideas of working and not-working technology. If one learns a new alphabet via typing, but ends up forgetting it sooner than if they were handwriting, the technology of typing isn't working for the user in that situation.
